## Default
This is what a normal paragraph \<p> looks like. And here is a paragraph <a href="#">with a link inside</a> it. Lovely.

Here's another paragraph to show spacing.

-----------------

## Text sizes
<p class="txt--xxs">.txt--xxs</p>

Use this for very low level information only, such as terms and conditions.

-----------------

<p class="txt--xs">.txt--xs</p>

Use this for information that is useful but not part of the content, such as a disclaimer

-----------------

<p class="txt--sm">.txt--sm</p>

This is the default text size so you'll only need this to override text that's been resized

-----------------

<p class="txt--md">.txt--md</p>

This size should be used to give more emphasis to a block of text

-----------------

<p class="txt--lg">.txt--lg</p>

The .lg size should be used for short, bursts of important information (not titles, always use a [heading](/text/headings/) for those)

----------------

<p class="txt--xl">.txt--xl</p>

.xl can be used for short, attention-seeking blocks of text where a [h2 heading](/text/headings/) is not suitable.

----------------

<p class="txt--xxl">.txt--xxl</p>

This is for emergencies only. 

OK, you can use it when you need something shouty but a [h1 heading](/text/headings/) isn't suitable.
